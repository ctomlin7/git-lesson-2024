# Git Lesson

This lesson covers the basics of git for version control.

This lesson is for the first day of the MSSE bootcamp (Chem 280).

To make a commit which is a version, or checkpoint, of your files, follow this procedure:

1. Make changes to your project that you would like to keep
2. When you have your changes, tell `git` you are ready to create a checkpoint of the file using the `git add FILENAME`
command
3. Create a checkpoint of your file using `git commit -m "Message about what you did"`.

## Pull Requesting

To submit your feature to be incorporated to the main branch, you should submit a `Pull Request`. 
The repository maintainers will review your pull request before accepting your changes.
